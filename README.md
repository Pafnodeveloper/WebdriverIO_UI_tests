# WebdriverIO_UI_tests

To run tests you need nodejs 12 or above

from the root directory (where package.josn file is located) implement "npm i" command
then you can choose what script to run

"npm run lang" for checking languages changes
"npm run currencyRates" for the suite directly related to the all rates page 
"npm run all" speaks for itself
